Disease,Symptom,Solution,Early Detection Symptom
Corn_Common_Rust,Small reddish-brown pustules appear on both sides of the leaves primarily on the lower leaves As the infection progresses these pustules rupture and release rust-colored spores leading to reduced photosynthetic capacity and early leaf senescence,Apply fungicides such as azoxystrobin or mancozeb during the early stages of infection Ensure even coverage of leaves with fungicides Crop rotation and use of rust-resistant corn varieties can help in long-term management,Light yellow spots on leaves especially on the lower surfaces
Corn_Gray_Leaf_Spot,Rectangular grayish-brown lesions running parallel to leaf veins As the disease advances lesions coalesce causing leaf blight and premature death of the foliage reducing grain fill,Use resistant hybrids to minimize the risk Apply foliar fungicides such as strobilurins or triazoles at disease onset Crop rotation and removing infected debris can also help limit the spread,Small pale green to yellow spots forming first on the lower leaves eventually expanding upwards
Corn_Northern_Leaf_Blight,Large cigar-shaped gray-green lesions on leaves primarily on the lower leaves that gradually spread to upper foliage The lesions eventually turn brown and can cause significant leaf tissue destruction reducing yield,Apply fungicides like propiconazole at the first sign of the disease Plant disease-resistant corn varieties and implement crop rotation to reduce inoculum levels,Small elliptical light tan lesions that start on older leaves often accompanied by early leaf drop
Cotton_Alternaria,Brown concentric rings or target-shaped spots develop on leaves primarily in the lower canopy As the disease spreads the leaves turn yellow and fall prematurely leading to defoliation and reduced yield,Use fungicides like mancozeb or chlorothalonil to manage the disease Crop rotation with non-host plants and removing infected debris can reduce disease pressure,Small yellow or pale brown spots forming on the lower leaves
Cotton_Healthy,No visible signs of disease,No action required maintain regular monitoring to ensure early intervention if symptoms develop,No signs of disease
Cotton_Mealybug_Attack,White waxy masses composed of mealybugs appear on leaves stems and even roots Infested plants exhibit leaf curling stunted growth and may develop sooty mold on the honeydew secreted by the insects,Use systemic insecticides like imidacloprid or acetamiprid to manage mealybug populations Biological control using natural predators like ladybugs is also effective,Sticky honeydew on leaves early leaf curling and clusters of small white insects on the stems
Cotton_Potassium_Deficiency,Yellowing of leaf edges that eventually develops into necrotic spots typically on older leaves Severe deficiency leads to leaf curl and premature leaf drop,Apply potassium fertilizers based on soil test results to correct the deficiency Ensure balanced fertilization with appropriate levels of nitrogen phosphorus and potassium,Light discoloration on the edges of older leaves
Cotton_Thrip,Silvery streaks appear on young leaves accompanied by leaf distortion and stunted growth Thrip feeding causes the leaves to appear deformed and curled,Apply insecticides like spinosad or abamectin to control thrips Crop rotation and avoiding planting near thrip-infested fields can minimize infestations,Shiny silvery patches on the youngest leaves with some slight distortion in shape
Cotton_White_Flies,White flying insects cluster on the undersides of leaves They secrete honeydew which leads to the development of black sooty mold blocking sunlight from reaching the leaf surface and reducing photosynthesis,Use insect growth regulators like pyriproxyfen or biological control agents like parasitic wasps to manage whitefly populations Proper sanitation and avoiding over-fertilization can help limit outbreaks,Whiteflies visible on leaf undersides and sticky honeydew spots begin forming
Potato_Early_Blight,Brown spots with concentric rings form primarily on the lower older leaves As the disease progresses the spots expand and cause defoliation reducing tuber size and yield,Apply fungicides like chlorothalonil or copper-based sprays to control the disease Crop rotation and avoiding overhead irrigation can reduce disease pressure,Small dark brown or black spots with a characteristic ring pattern start appearing on the lower leaves
Potato_Healthy,No visible signs of disease,No action required maintain regular monitoring to ensure early intervention if symptoms develop,No signs of disease
Potato_Late_Blight,Water-soaked lesions form on leaves often starting at the leaf tips or edges The lesions turn brown and the undersides of the leaves may exhibit white fungal growth in humid conditions Stems and tubers may also be affected,Apply fungicides such as metalaxyl or mancozeb at the first sign of infection Remove and destroy infected plants Ensure proper spacing between plants to improve air circulation,Small dark green water-soaked spots on the leaves that rapidly spread especially in humid conditions
Rice_Brown_Spot,Small circular or oval brown spots with gray centers form on leaves and sometimes on grains Severe infections reduce photosynthesis and lead to yield losses,Use fungicides such as carbendazim or mancozeb Ensure balanced soil nutrition especially adequate levels of potassium and phosphorus to reduce susceptibility to the disease,Tiny brown lesions with yellow halos appearing on seedling leaves
Rice_Healthy,No visible signs of disease,No action required maintain regular monitoring to ensure early intervention if symptoms develop,No signs of disease
Rice_Leaf_Blast,Diamond-shaped gray spots with brown margins appear on the leaf tips In severe cases the lesions spread rapidly causing significant tissue loss and reducing the plant's ability to photosynthesize,Apply fungicides like tricyclazole or isoprothiolane at the first sign of infection Use resistant rice varieties and practice water management to reduce humidity around the plants,Small white or grayish spots forming at the tips of leaves
Rice_Neck_Blast,Brown lesions form on the neck of the panicle weakening the panicle and leading to poor grain fill and panicle collapse,Use preventive fungicides like tricyclazole at the booting stage Effective water management and maintaining field hygiene can reduce the spread of the disease,Early wilting or drooping of the neck or panicle
Sugarcane_Bacterial_Blight,Yellow water-soaked lesions form on the leaves which then turn red or brown Severe infections lead to leaf blight and reduced sugar content in the stalk,Use copper-based bactericides and ensure good sanitation practices such as removing infected debris and avoiding mechanical damage to plants,Small translucent yellowish lesions forming on younger leaves
Sugarcane_Healthy,No visible signs of disease,No action required maintain regular monitoring to ensure early intervention if symptoms develop,No signs of disease
Sugarcane_Red_Rot,Red discoloration develops internally in the stalk with white patches The affected stalks are weakened and often collapse The disease can spread quickly leading to the death of the plant,Destroy infected plants and treat the field with fungicides like carbendazim Ensure crop rotation and field hygiene to reduce the risk of future infections,Early drying of leaves and reddening of the internal stalk
Wheat_Brown_Rust,Small orange-brown pustules form on the upper surface of the leaves In severe infections the rust spores can cover most of the leaf surface leading to significant yield loss,Apply fungicides like tebuconazole at the first sign of rust Plant rust-resistant varieties and rotate crops to reduce disease pressure,Small pale yellow spots forming on the leaves usually seen early in the season
Wheat_Healthy,No visible signs of disease,No action required maintain regular monitoring to ensure early intervention if symptoms develop,No signs of disease
Wheat_Yellow_Rust,Yellow stripe-like pustules form on the leaves and stems spreading rapidly in cool moist conditions Severe infections can cause premature leaf death and reduce grain fill,Apply fungicides like triadimefon or propiconazole Plant resistant varieties and monitor crops regularly especially in cooler climates,Pale yellow streaks forming along the veins of the leaves

Disease,Symptom,Solution,Early Detection Symptom
Corn___Common_Rust,Small round reddish-brown spots on both sides of the leaves that turn powdery,Apply fungicides such as azoxystrobin or mancozeb in recommended dosages to control the spread of fungal spores and ensure good air circulation by spacing plants to reduce humidity,Look for small pale yellow spots forming on the leaves that may turn reddish over time
Corn___Gray_Leaf_Spot,Long narrow gray-brown patches along the veins of the leaves,Plant corn hybrids with resistance to gray leaf spot and apply foliar fungicides at early stages of disease development to prevent spread and rotate crops to reduce pathogen presence in soil,Observe lower leaves for tiny light green or yellow spots along the veins that might start spreading as disease progresses
Corn___Northern_Leaf_Blight,Large oval grayish lesions on leaves that expand and darken over time,Use resistant corn varieties and apply fungicides like propiconazole when initial symptoms appear and ensure proper field drainage to avoid excessive moisture which promotes disease,Check older leaves for small light brown to gray spots which may slowly enlarge and become cigar-shaped
Corn___Healthy,Leaves are green with no spots or lesions,Regularly monitor crops and practice crop rotation to minimize the risk of disease and maintain adequate nutrient levels for healthy growth,Healthy plants will show no early signs of spotting or discoloration
Cotton___Alternaria,Dark brown or black circular spots with yellow edges on leaves,Apply preventive fungicides such as mancozeb at the first sign of spotting and avoid planting in low-lying areas where water may collect,Early signs include small yellow spots on lower leaves that gradually darken to brown or black
Cotton___Healthy,Leaves are bright green without any discoloration or spots,Maintain good crop rotation and remove any diseased plants from the field to prevent spread of infections,Healthy plants should show no unusual color changes or spotting on the leaves
Cotton___Mealybug_Attack,White cottony clusters found on stems leaves and buds,Apply systemic insecticides such as imidacloprid to control infestation and prune infected plant parts and dispose of them away from the field to prevent re-infestation,Early signs include white waxy spots appearing on stems leaf joints or new buds
Cotton___Potassium_Deficiency,Yellowing of leaf edges with a burnt look on older leaves,Apply potassium-based fertilizers to correct deficiency and boost plant health and test soil nutrient levels to maintain balance,Initial signs are yellowing along the edges of lower leaves which may develop a burnt or brown appearance over time
Cotton___Thrip,Silvery patches on leaves with black specks (excrement),Apply insecticides such as spinosad and install blue or yellow sticky traps around plants to capture adult thrips,Watch for distorted or curled young leaves that may have small silvery streaks or discoloration
Cotton___White_Flies,White small flies clustering on the undersides of leaves,Use neem oil sprays regularly and apply suitable insecticides based on infestation level,Check the undersides of leaves for small yellow patches or tiny white flies moving when leaves are disturbed
Potato___Early_Blight,Dark brown spots with concentric rings on older leaves,Apply protective fungicides such as chlorothalonil when initial spots are observed and rotate with non-host crops to reduce soilborne spores,Look for small brown spots with ring patterns on lower leaves that increase in size gradually
Potato___Healthy,Leaves are green with no visible spots or lesions,Ensure balanced soil nutrients with regular fertilization and remove any diseased plants promptly,No visible changes or signs of disease should be present on healthy plants
Potato___Late_Blight,Large dark or black patches on leaves sometimes with white fungal growth,Use fungicides such as mancozeb or metalaxyl to prevent spread and destroy infected plants and avoid planting in infected soils,Check for small pale green spots at leaf edges that may enlarge and darken rapidly under humid conditions
Rice___Brown_Spot,Round brown spots with gray centers on leaves,Apply fungicides such as carbendazim at recommended intervals and use balanced fertilization to strengthen plant resistance,Observe for small light brown spots on leaves which may appear first on lower leaves and spread upwards
Rice___Healthy,Leaves appear lush green without any signs of discoloration,Apply balanced fertilizers regularly and monitor plant health to prevent nutrient deficiencies,Healthy plants show no abnormal coloration or spots on the leaves
Rice___Leaf_Blast,Diamond-shaped grayish spots with brown edges on leaves,Apply recommended fungicides and avoid overuse of nitrogen fertilizers and plant resistant rice varieties when possible,Look for small brown dots or spots on leaves that may expand and form diamond shapes as disease progresses
Rice___Neck_Blast,Gray or brown lesions around the neck of the panicle,Plant disease-resistant varieties and apply preventive fungicides at booting stage and avoid excessive nitrogen,Early symptoms include small brown spots around the neck area of the panicle which may expand over time
Sugarcane___Bacterial_Blight,Watery dark streaks on leaves that dry and turn brown,Use resistant varieties when available and avoid causing leaf injuries during cultivation,Observe small wet-looking spots along the veins of young leaves which may darken as disease advances
Sugarcane___Healthy,Leaves are green and healthy with no signs of disease,Practice good field hygiene by removing any diseased plants immediately and avoid injury to plants,Healthy plants show no signs of discoloration or spotting on leaves
Sugarcane___Red_Rot,Red discoloration inside the stalk with white patches,Use disease-free stalk cuttings for planting and apply fungicides and improve drainage to reduce risk of rot,Initial symptoms include a faint rotting smell and faint red streaks appearing inside the stalks
Wheat___Brown_Rust,Small round brown spots on leaves becoming raised and dusty,Apply fungicides such as propiconazole at early stages and ensure crop rotation to reduce rust buildup,Look for yellowish dots forming on leaves which may later develop into raised rusty spots
Wheat___Healthy,Leaves are green and free from any visible signs of disease,Practice regular crop rotation and use resistant wheat varieties to avoid disease buildup,Healthy wheat shows no signs of spotting or discoloration on the leaves
Wheat___Yellow_Rust,Small yellow-orange spots in rows on leaves,Apply fungicides such as azoxystrobin at the first signs of infection and plant rust-resistant wheat varieties,Watch for light yellow patches on leaves that slowly turn into small raised yellow spots arranged in rows
